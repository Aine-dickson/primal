# Working Syntax

Candidate A amended as accepted in D-028: A's keyword-led statements, with grouped declaration and flow blocks, interval ranges and the timeline shorthand (owner amendment), C's view trees, nested interactions, explicit sequences and named processes, and B's default space.

- **Status:** working syntax, implemented by the prototype parser (`crates/prismal-syntax`). Non-binding until the syntax is frozen; keywords and spellings are subject to the keyword pass (comparison section 8.2).
- **Fixed parts:** the shared expression and type sublanguage of the study (`README.md`), with interval notation as the single range form.

## 1. Design

### 1.1 Model

| Form | Kernel element |
|---|---|
| `space Plane = euclidean(2)` | space (MK-4.1) |
| `model Name [in Space] { ... }` | root object type; with `in Space`, `origin`, `Point` and `Vector<D>` refer to that space; `object` for contained types |
| `const { x: T = e ... }` | constants |
| `param { x: T = e [in I \| where cond] [modifiers] ... }` | parameters; `in I` or `where` attaches a `reject` constraint (MK-12.4) |
| `input { x: T ... }` | inputs |
| `state { x: T = e ... }` | continuous state with initial definitions |
| `discrete { x: T = e ... }` | discrete state |
| `derived { x: T = e; f(x: A): B = e ... }` | derived bindings, including function-valued ones |
| `enum Phase { a, b, c }` | enumeration (MK-2.2a, D-049); cases by name (`a`) or qualified (`Phase.a`) |
| `fn f(x: A): B = e` | declared function (MK-10.3a, D-048): reads only its parameters, constants and other functions |
| `flow { der(x) = e; der(y) += e ... }` | defining flows and contributions (MK-14.7) |
| `process P { flow ...; event ... }` | named process (MK-14.1), optional |
| `event E on <trigger> [if cond] [{ ops }] [zeno stop \| zeno settle { ops }]` | event (MK-15) |
| `equation N: lhs == rhs [checked within tol]` | equation (MK-11) |
| `constraint [N:] cond [within tol] [policy p]` | constraint (MK-12) |
| `object Name { ... }` | object type (MK-7.13, D-055), declared in a model, with the body of a model |
| `parts { a: T [{ x = e ... }]  c: T[n] [{ x = e ... }] }` | a contained object, or a collection of `n` members; overrides and input connections, with `index` the member's number (MK-8.3a) |
| `flow { for b in c { der(b.x) = e ... } }` | flows written by the container for each member (MK-8.8) |
| `parts { c: T[max m]  d: T[n, max m] { ... } }` | a collection whose membership changes (MK-8.2a, D-057): none or `n` members at the start, at most `m` made in a run |
| `for b in c { event E on ... { ops } }` | an event of the model repeated for each member (MK-15.1b) |
| `relation R(a in c, b in d) { ... }` | relation type (MK-8.5a, D-058); its endpoints are members of `c` and `d`; a part of type `R` is a relation set |

Every block keyword also has a one-line form for a single declaration (`param g: Acceleration = 9.81 m/s^2`, `flow der(x) = v`). Both parse to the same IR; the formatter prints blocks.

**Intervals** are the one range notation: `[a, b]`, `(a, b)`, `[a, b)`, `(a, b]`, with `inf` for an unbounded end. `x in [a, b)` is the constraint `a <= x < b`; an unbounded end gives a one-sided comparison (`in [0, inf)` is `x >= 0`, the same as `where x >= 0`). After a declaration's value, `in` starts the declaration's range; a membership test used as a value is written in parentheses: `ok: Boolean = (x in [0, 1))`. The formatter prints a parameter's `reject` constraint as an interval when it bounds only that parameter from both sides, as `where` otherwise.

Modifiers after a declaration: `intervenable`, `private`, `symbol "v"`, `unit deg`, and on discrete state `combine sum` (also `product`, `min`, `max`, `any`, `all`; D-073), the combination of `contribute` operations.

Expressions add `match e { a => x, b => y }` (one arm per case, arms separated by commas or lines) to the shared sublanguage, and members (D-055): `a.x`, `c[k].x` with a constant `k`, `b.x` for a loop variable; aggregates `sum(e for b in c [if cond])`, likewise `min`, `max`, `any`, `all`, and `count(c)` or `count(b for b in c if cond)`. In views and representation blocks, `for b in c { reps }` repeats each representation per member. `parts` and `index` are contextual words.

Triggers: `rising(g)`, `falling(g)`, `crossing(g)`, `at τ`, `every Δ [from τ0]`, `on E [(p: T)]`, `on start`, `on input(i)`, `on request [(p: T)]`; `(p: T)` names the payload the occurrence receives (D-050). A payload may be a member, `(b in balls)`, and an event may declare several, `(b in balls, j: Momentum)` (D-059). `emit E(v)` and `emit E(b, j)` supply payloads. A target may go through an endpoint: `set s.a.vel = e`. `input { x: T [= default] }` declares an input with an optional default (D-051). Operations: `set`, `contribute`, `create`, `destroy`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `emit`. `create c { x = e ... }` makes a member of `c` with starting values; `destroy b` ends the member `b`; `set b.x = e` writes a member's binding from its container (D-057). `max` in `[n, max m]` is a contextual word; `[max inf]` declares no limit (D-066). `connect rs(x, y) { k = e }` makes a relation, `disconnect s` ends one; `s.a` is the member at an endpoint (D-058); `relation` is a contextual word. `undirected relation R(a in c, b in c)` has no order outside its body; `s.has(o)` and `s.other(o)` read endpoints without one (D-064). A collection of a contained object is named by its path, `left.atoms`, in endpoints, members, loops and aggregates (D-065).

### 1.2 Presentation

| Form | Element |
|---|---|
| `presentation Name for Model { ... }` | presentation |
| `observe { name = expr schedule ... }` | observations; schedules `live`, `every Δ`, `at τ`, `on E [microstep n]`, `over I` |
| `view name: spatial(Space, scale: 1 m -> 40 px, y: up) { reps }`, `view name: plot(x: I, y: I) { reps }` | views containing their representations |
| `panel name { reps }` | region without a coordinate system (controls, formulas) |
| `rep(...) [as name] { on drag [part] as p { propose x = e } }` | representation with its declared inverse; in `for b in c { ... }`, `propose b.x = e` moves that member (D-059) |
| `rep(...) [as name] { on click request E(v) }` | representation that requests an event when clicked; `on click request E(b)` for its member (D-059) |
| `segment(P, Q, color: blue, line: dashed)` | author styles: a named color and a line style (D-061) |
| `view v: ... { on click as q request E(q) ... }` | a view that requests an event with the point clicked, where no representation takes the click (D-060) |
| `group(at: P, rotate: θ, scale: k) [as name] { reps }` | representations placed, turned and scaled together; members are written in the group's frame (D-043) |
| `trace(pos every 0.02 s)`, `series_plot(y every 0.01 s)` | a sampled source: `expr every Δ`, only as a representation's argument (PK-6.3a) |
| `plot(x: [0 s, 6 s], y: [0 m, 1.1 m])` | plot axes with dimensions; a plot marker is at a pair in those dimensions, `marker(at: (0, y))` (PK-7.3a) |
| `permit learner { ... }` | permissions |
| `layout row(scene, column(plot, controls))` | page layout: views side by side in a row, one below the other in a column, nested (D-063) |
| `timeline { scene S { beat B { actions } } }` | timeline; run-directing actions apply in written order at the beat's start, then the others start together (D-033); `sequence { }` orders actions that take time |
| `run rate r until E` | shorthand for `run rate r` and `wait until E` in the same beat |
| `reveal fade\|draw [for d] [in view] { reps }`, `hide name [for d]`, `camera view [to P] [zoom z] [for d]` | animations of the presentation (D-042) |
| `animate name opacity\|offset to v [for d]`, `release name`, `bind name [for d]` | animated properties and the handover of a bound representation (D-068) |
| `wait learner [limit d] [fallback { actions }]` | a continue point (D-067) |

### 1.3 Runs

`run Name of Model with Presentation { param { ... } input { x = v; x = v at τ } config { ... } until τ; learner { ... } expect { ... } }`. `input` gives inputs their starting values and later changes (D-051). A timeline's `request E(v)` supplies a payload (D-050); `request E(balls[2], v)` supplies a member and a value (D-059). A learner step is `at τ: continue`, `at τ: set slider x = v` or `at τ: press E` (an explore beat's button, D-069). `button(reset)`, `button(undo)` and `button(redo)` are runtime-control buttons of labs (D-069).

### 1.4 Canonical printing (C4)

The formatter prints, from the IR: enumerations, then declarations grouped in blocks by role, in the order kind (const, param, input, state, discrete, derived), then functions, flows, processes, events, equations, constraints; parameter ranges as intervals when two-sided on that parameter alone; `run ... until` when a beat holds exactly those two actions; representations inside their views. Everything else prints in its only form. Author notes print as `///` comments before their element; other comments are not in the IR and are not printed (D-036). Implemented by `prismal_syntax::format`; `cargo run -p prismal-syntax --example fmt -- FILE` prints a program in this form.

### 1.5 Lexical rules and reserved words (D-035)

- **Source text** is UTF-8. Identifiers are a letter or `_` followed by letters, digits or `_`; letters include Unicode letters (`θ`, `ω`, `θ0`). Identifiers are case-sensitive.
- **Numbers:** `12`, `0.5`, `1e-9`, `2.5e3`. A number directly followed by `π` or `pi` (`2π`) is a product; any other name directly after a number is an error (write `2 * x`). A minus sign written on a number is part of the literal (`-5`).
- **Units** follow a number and are written with unit symbols, `*`, `/` and integer powers: `9.81 m/s^2`, `4 N/m`, `0.01 /m`, `45 deg`. The unit ends at the first token that cannot continue it. A unit has no spaces inside it, so a space before `/`, `*` or `^` ends it: `0.01 /m` is a unit, while `4 / m` divides by the binding `m`. Unit symbols are recognized only directly after a number; elsewhere `m`, `s` and `g` are ordinary names.
- **Operators** are ASCII: `+ - * / ^ == != < <= > >= = += -> => .. | . , : ;` and the words `and`, `or`, `not`, `if`, `then`, `else`, `otherwise`. `|v|` is the norm.
- **Comments:** `//` to end of line. `///` is a documentation comment; together with an ordinary comment block directly before a declaration it becomes that element's author notes in the IR (D-036).
- **Statements** end at a newline or `;`. Several statements on one line are separated by `;`. A line ending in an operator (other than a closing `|`), `,`, an open bracket or one of the operator words continues on the next line; so does every line inside `( )` or `[ ]`.
- **Reserved words** (D-040), never names: `space model presentation run object const param input state discrete derived fn flow process event equation constraint on if then else and or not otherwise in where true false zeno stop settle set contribute create destroy connect disconnect emit enter checked within policy reject report intervenable private symbol unit rising falling crossing at every from start request enum match`.
- **Representation kinds** are read where a representation is expected; there `equation`, reserved elsewhere, is the representation kind of PK-6.3.
- **Contextual keywords** (D-040), recognized only where such a word is expected and ordinary names elsewhere (`process drag`, `view scene`): `for view panel observe live over microstep show as drag click propose permit timeline scene beat sequence rate until hold seek reset branch intervene wait explore limit keep fallback narrate highlight hide reveal zoom animate camera bind release config expect exactly rel of with learner continue press undo redo combine ease`.
- **Built-in names** (not reserved, but predefined): `t`, `t0`, `elapsed`, `origin`, `der`, `π` and `pi` (D-039), `inf` (only as an interval bound), the SI units and named dimensions of MK section 3. Named dimensions: `Length`, `Mass`, `Time`, `Current`, `Amount`, `Area`, `Volume`, `Velocity`, `Acceleration`, `Frequency`, `Momentum`, `Force`, `Energy`, `Power`, `Pressure`, and `Angle` (dimensionless, D-021); base symbols `L M T I Θ N J` inside `Quantity<...>`.

## 2. Notes

- **Blocks versus local marks.** Grouped blocks make the role sectional rather than local (comparison section 3), but unlike B's sections each block is a brace-delimited keyword block whose role word is never more than a screen away, and it survives copy and paste. The one-line form is still available where a single declaration is quoted or moved.
- **`in` has two uses:** a range on a declaration (`in [0, 1)`) and a target view in a timeline (`in scene { ... }`). They occur in different contexts; the keyword pass may still separate them.
- **Mode conditions remain** (`if flying then ... else 0`); modes stay deferred (D-028).
- **The reference programs are now written in this syntax** (`docs/spec/reference-programs/`), with the corrections of 2026-09-30. Where the two differ, the reference programs are current.

## History

- 2026-09-29 written after D-028 was accepted with amendment.
- 2026-09-30 zero vectors written `0` (D-030); `sequence` dropped where D-033 orders run-directing actions; reference programs converted.
- 2026-09-30 payloads (`on E(p: T)`, `request E(v)`) and inputs (defaults, a run's `input` block) implemented (D-050, D-051).
- 2026-10-01 member payloads and several payloads (`on request(b in balls, j: T)`, `request E(balls[2], v)`) implemented (D-059).
- 2026-10-01 drags on members (`propose b.pos = p`) and clicks (`on click request E(b)`) implemented (D-059).
- 2026-10-01 clicks on an empty point of a view (`on click as q request E(q)`) implemented (D-060).
- 2026-10-01 author styles `color:` and `line:` implemented (D-061).
- 2026-09-30 `enum`, `fn` and `match` implemented (D-048, D-049); `enum` and `match` reserved; `=>` added.
- 2026-09-30 implemented by the text parser. Lexical rules made precise (units without spaces, names after numbers, statement separators, `in` after a declaration's value, `inf`); reserved words split into reserved words and contextual keywords (D-040); `π` kept by name (D-039); RP-07 observation `state` renamed `values`.
- 2026-09-30 sampled sources (`expr every Δ`) and plot axes with dimensions, from the web player.
- 2026-09-30 canonical printing implemented (`prismal-syntax/src/format.rs`); a one-sided interval lowers as the comparison `where` writes (`x >= lo`), so both spellings give one IR.
- 2026-09-30 `reveal`, `hide ... for`, `camera` (D-042); `hide`, `reveal` and `zoom` added to the contextual keywords.
- 2026-09-30 `group` with its members in a block (D-043).
- 2026-09-30 `object` declarations, `parts`, member expressions, aggregates, `for` in flows and representation blocks (D-055).
- 2026-09-30 `relation` declarations, `connect`, `disconnect`, endpoints `s.a` (D-058).
- 2026-09-30 capacities `[max m]` and `[n, max m]`, `create`, `destroy`, member targets `set b.x`, `for` blocks of events (D-057).
- 2026-10-01 `layout`, `row`, `column`: page layout of views (D-063); added to the contextual keywords.
- 2026-10-01 `undirected relation`, `s.has(o)`, `s.other(o)` (D-064); part paths `left.atoms` (D-065).
- 2026-10-01 `[max inf]`: collections without a declared limit (D-066).
- 2026-10-01 `wait learner` (D-067); `animate`, `release`, `bind` defined (D-068).
- 2026-10-01 learner step `press E`; runtime-control buttons; `press`, `undo` and `redo` added to the contextual keywords (D-069).
