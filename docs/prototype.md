# Rust Kernel Prototype

The first implementation of Prismal's core semantics, built kernel-first (D-002): a Rust library and API that runs the first-slice reference programs (D-012) against the specification (`docs/spec/`). Programs are written in the working syntax (D-028) and lowered to the IR by the text parser, or built through the IR API.

- **Status:** v0 prototype, 2026-09-30. Every expectation of RP-01 to RP-08 is checked, model side and presentation side. The text parser reads all eight programs from their documents and lowers them, presentations and runs included, to the IR. The web player runs them in a browser.
- **Build and test:** `cargo test` at the repository root (Rust 1.94 or later). `cargo run --release -p prismal-runtime --example report` prints the measured errors quoted below.

## Structure

| Crate | Specification | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/prismal-ir` | `04-ir.md` | IR types with JSON serialization (D-037), dimensions and units, a builder API |
| `crates/prismal-kernel` | `01-model-kernel.md` | Type and dimension checking with expected-type propagation (D-030, D-032), static diagnostics MK-E01 to MK-E22, dependency analysis, compilation, evaluation with statuses |
| `crates/prismal-syntax` | `docs/syntax-study/working-syntax.md`, `04-ir.md` | Lexer, parser to a syntax tree, lowering of spaces, models, presentations and runs to the IR with a source map, located diagnostics |
| `crates/prismal-present` | `03-presentation-kernel.md`, `04-ir.md` section 7 | Presentation checks, observation, expectations, projection and frame descriptions, formula typesetting for every medium (`math.rs`, D-046), interaction, the explanation timeline |
| `crates/prismal-host` | `05-host-interface.md` | The host interface: an engine of documents (from text or the IR, updated with identities kept) and instances (sessions and lessons), with a Rust API and the JSON protocol |
| `crates/prismal-web` and `web/` | D-018, `03-presentation-kernel.md` section 12 | The web player: the host interface compiled to WebAssembly and a browser front end that renders frame descriptions |
| `crates/prismal-stdio` | `05-host-interface.md` HI-6.4 | The host interface as a process: the JSON protocol over standard input and output, one request and one response per line, with request ids; a Python host (`client.py`) |
| `crates/prismal-svg` | `03-presentation-kernel.md` section 12, `05-host-interface.md` section 5 | The SVG renderer: frame descriptions drawn as standalone SVG documents with no browser, for still images, vector documents and image sequences |
| `crates/prismal-media` | `03-presentation-kernel.md` section 12, D-052 | Media export: the SVG renderer's frames rasterized (resvg) and encoded by an external encoder (ffmpeg) as video files, PNG stills and PNG sequences, with captions as WebVTT |
| `crates/prismal-runtime` | `02-runtime-contract.md` | Runs, `dopri5` and `rk4` with dense output, crossing detection and location, event iteration in superdense time, Zeno detection, constraints and equation checks, interventions and requests, time events, observation, an interactive session with undo and redo |

The reference programs are in `crates/prismal-runtime/tests/common/mod.rs`, each mirroring its working-syntax text in `docs/spec/reference-programs/`. Each program has its own test file.

## Text parser

`crates/prismal-syntax` reads the working syntax (D-028, D-035, D-040) and lowers it to the IR the kernel checks and the runtime runs.

1. **Lexer** (`lexer.rs`): tokens with line and column, comments kept for notes (D-036). Newlines end statements except inside `( )` and `[ ]` and after a continuing operator or word (working syntax section 1.5).
2. **Parser** (`parser.rs`): recursive descent to a syntax tree (`ast.rs`) for all four top-level forms: `space`, `model`, `presentation`, `run`. A statement that fails to parse is reported and skipped to the next statement end at the same brace depth, so every error in a file is reported in one pass.
3. **Lowering** (`lower.rs`, `lower_present.rs`): spaces, models, presentations and runs to the IR (04-ir sections 5 and 7), with a source map from each IR identity to its declaration.
4. **Checking** (`check`): the kernel's static checks, with each diagnostic placed at the declaration of the element it names.

`cargo run -p prismal-syntax --example prismalc -- FILE [--ir]` checks a source file or a Markdown document (its `text` and `cases` blocks) and prints the diagnostics, or the IR as JSON:

```text
bad.prismal:4:22: MK-E01: type or dimension mismatch: found Quantity<L T^-1>, expected Quantity<L T^-2>
      flow { der(y) = v; der(v) = -g * 2 s }
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

### Lowering choices

| Construct | IR | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Identities | declaration paths: `Model.name`, `Model.event.name`, `Model.process.name`, `Model.equation.name`, `Model.constraint.name`, `Model.flow.n` (n-th flow in source order) | D-036; the same identities the builder API gives |
| `where cond`, `in I` on a parameter | a `reject` constraint `name_range`, attached to the parameter | MK-12.4, 04-ir section 5.4 |
| `constraint` without a name | named `c1`, `c2`, ... by position | the IR needs a name; a named constraint keeps its identity across edits |
| Constraint without `policy` | `report` | MK-12.4 |
| `every Δ` without `from` | `from t0` | MK-15.3 |
| Process kind | `continuous` if the process has flows, otherwise `discrete` | MK-14.1: the IR carries the kind; the working syntax has no spelling for it yet |
| `-5`, `-1e-8 m` | a negative literal | IR-1.1: one surface form of a negative literal (04-ir section 6) |
| `2π` | `2 * {"const": "pi"}` | D-039 |
| `in [0, inf)` | `0 <= x` | the IR holds no infinities (04-ir section 6) |
| `a < b <= c` | `a < b and b <= c` | 04-ir section 6 |
| `v.y` | component by the axes of the default space (`x`, `y`, `z` without one) | MK-4.2 |

### Diagnostics of the text

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| SX-E01 | lexical error (unexpected character, unterminated string) |
| SX-E02 | syntax error; includes `=` written where `==` is meant, and a name directly after a number |
| SX-E03 | unknown name, event, space or component |
| SX-E04 | unknown type or dimension |
| SX-E05 | unknown unit (including `px` in a model) |
| SX-E06 | construct not in the v0 IR (`object`, collections) |
| SX-E07 | reserved word used as a name (D-040) |
| SX-E08 | form not allowed here (presentation forms in a model, `origin` without a default space, a range on a non-parameter, arity) |
| SX-E09 | duplicate declaration (spaces, models, processes, events, equations, constraints; duplicate bindings are the kernel's MK-E22) |

### Acceptance by text

The reference programs are read from their documents in `docs/spec/reference-programs/`, so the documents are the test input.

| Test | Content |
|---|---|
| `prismal-syntax/tests/documents.rs` | every `text` and `cases` block of the reference programs and of the working-syntax document parses (28 blocks); every reference-program document lowers |
| `prismal-runtime/tests/text_programs.rs` | the lowered models of RP-01 to RP-08 equal the builder models of `tests/common` exactly, survive JSON and check; 19 diagnostic variants and model variant RP-03.V1, written as one-line text edits, give their named codes; (the `cases` blocks are run by `prismal-present`) |
| `prismal-syntax/tests/rules.rs` | lexical rules, lowering choices, notes, located and recovered diagnostics |

RP-01.D1 is not covered by text: it is stored in IR form because the working syntax has no level-style trigger.

### Formatter and identities

`prismal_syntax::format` prints an IR document in the canonical form of working syntax section 1.4: declarations in blocks by role with aligned columns, then flows, processes, events, equations and constraints; parameter ranges as intervals when two-sided, as `where` otherwise; `run rate r until E`; representations in their views; author notes as `///` comments. Dimensions print as authors write them (`Quantity<1/L>`, `Quantity<M/T^2>`), a dimensionless binding with an angle display unit as `Angle`.

`prismal_syntax::identity` implements D-036. `reconcile(new, prev)` gives each element of a newly lowered document the identity it had in the previous IR, matched by declaration path (by name within its container; flows by target, kind, process and position), restores the previous order of every list with new elements appended (IR-1.7), and gives an unmatched element whose path identity a renamed element holds a fresh one (`Model.speed~2`). `rename(doc, id, name)` is a tool rename that keeps the identity (a parameter's range constraint follows it). `diff(prev, new)` lists removed and added identities: a rename made in plain text shows as both.

`cargo run -p prismal-syntax --example fmt -- FILE [--previous IR.json] [--ir OUT.json]` prints the canonical form, matching and reporting identities against a previous IR. The web player's Source tab has a Format button.

Acceptance (`prismal-web/tests/format.rs`): every reference program and every program of the guide (26) goes from text to IR to canonical text to IR and gives back the same IR after `reconcile`, and printing it again gives the same text; RP-01's canonical form; a tool rename of `speed` in RP-08 prints the new name at every reference and keeps the identity through another round trip; a plain-text rename in RP-06 is reported by `diff`.

## Presentation prototype

`crates/prismal-present` implements the presentation kernel (`03-presentation-kernel.md`) over the runtime, and the presentation and run IR (04-ir section 7), which the text parser now lowers.

| Module | Content |
|---|---|
| `check` | static checks of a presentation against its model, PK-E01 to PK-E06 (03 section 16) |
| `data` | observations of a run for every source (expression, event log, diagnostics, intervention log) and schedule (PK section 3) |
| `expect` | headless evaluation of run cases (PK-4.2); a case whose presentation has a timeline is played as a lesson |
| `frame` | representations compiled for their view with unit-aware scales (PK-5.5), projection on a state, frame descriptions with text alternatives (PK-6, PK-7.5, PK-11.1, PK-12.1) |
| `interact` | controls, drag transactions with validated previews, keyboard operation, undo and redo, refusal of actions a presentation does not offer (PK section 10, PK-11.2) |
| `timeline` | the lesson player: time mapping, D-033 order at a beat's start, `wait_until` from located event instants, explore beats on a branch with and without `keep`, video fallbacks, captions, announcements, frames at any presentation instant and export (PK sections 8, 9) |
| `text` | numbers, quantities with units, expressions printed with display symbols (D-034) |

`cargo run -p prismal-present --example cases -- FILE...` runs the cases of a program headless and reports every expectation (for a lesson, also the beat timings).

Representations implemented: `marker`, `arrow`, `segment`, `polyline`, `polygon`, `trace`, `function_graph`, `series_plot`, `label`, `formula`, `equation`, `table`, `slider`, `number_input`, `toggle`, `button`, `axes`, `grid`. A representation argument that names a model event or equation lowers to an `element` argument (04-ir section 7): `button(drop)` requests an `on request` event (D-027) at the instant shown, `equation(name)` typesets a model equation with its symbols' values. Timeline actions: all of PK-9.2 except `animate`, `camera`, `bind`, `release`, `reveal`, `wait_for_learner`; `hide` stops showing a named representation. Others are reported as PK-E06, never dropped.

An interactive session has a display clock (RC section 12): its run is computed to the configuration's end, `seek` chooses the instant shown, and the learner's actions take effect at that instant (RC-11.2), so the trajectory after it is recomputed and the one before it is unchanged; `reset` starts a new run with an empty log. A static model has one instant (RC-12.4).

### Acceptance

| Test | Content |
|---|---|
| `prismal-present/tests/cases.rs` | every case written in the working syntax (RP-01 to RP-05, RP-08) runs headless: all 36 expectations pass, including event lists, empty diagnostics and beat timings; the presentation and run IR survive JSON |
| `prismal-present/tests/rp06.rs` | RP-06's learner script through the presentation, E1 to E14; every frame shows one `a` in the graph, slider, formula and marker (E10) |
| `prismal-present/tests/rp07.rs` | RP-07's drag of `u`'s head through its declared inverse; the frame after the drag, E1 to E5 |
| `prismal-present/tests/rp08.rs` | RP-08 cases A (keep), B (no keep), C (video) and D (restricted), E1 to E16, including bit-identical landings on replay, captions, announcements, two identical exports, and the fallback report |
| `prismal-present/tests/checks.rs` | PK-E01 to PK-E06 on edits of RP-06, RP-07 and RP-08 |

## Host interface

`crates/prismal-host` implements `docs/spec/05-host-interface.md` (D-044, D-045): the interface through which any system embeds Prismal.

| Part | Content |
|---|---|
| `Engine` (`lib.rs`) | documents and instances by handle; `load`, `open`, `close`; `handle`, the JSON protocol (HI-6.2) with `capabilities` and the interface diagnostics HI-E01 to HI-E03 |
| `Document` (`document.rs`) | a program from source text, a Markdown document or the IR; loaded with its check diagnostics (by identity, located when from text); `update` with identities kept by `reconcile` and spans following them; `rename` keeping identity; IR, canonical text, catalogue, cases |
| `Instance` (`instance.rs`) | a presentation opened as a lesson or an interactive session: layout (views, coordinate systems, content extent, beats, captions, explore windows), frame descriptions with viewports and focus, the math box tree of a formula (for media with a math engine), observations as text, semantic and raw inputs, lesson inputs |
| `input.rs` | raw input (D-047): viewports of views (framing from the extent, growth to fit in sessions, the learner's zoom and pan, the timeline's camera), the mapping between a view's drawn pixels and view coordinates, hit testing of draggable parts with a reach by pointer kind (PK-10.2a), the focus order (PK-11.2b) |

Sessions and playbacks own their compiled model and presentation, and documents share their checked program with their instances by reference count, so closing a document or an instance frees it (HI-2.2); before, the web player kept every loaded program for the life of the page.

Raw input (D-047, HI-4.5): the host captures pointer, wheel and key events and forwards them in its own terms; the engine targets them, runs drags, pans and zooms, keeps keyboard focus, and answers whether it used each one. `prismal-web/tests/input.rs` drives it through the protocol alone, as a host other than a browser would: RP-07's arrow head grabbed and moved in a view drawn at its natural size and at twice that size, a touch reaching where a mouse misses, hover, cancel; RP-06's handle in plot pixels with an invalid proposal previewed and the last valid one committed; focus with Tab and Shift+Tab, arrow-key steps of the handle and the slider, focus returned to the host past the end, `focus` set directly; a button pressed and a toggle flipped with Enter and space; RP-08's wheel zoom about the pointer, a pan cancelled by Escape, `view_reset`, and an explore slider stepped from the keyboard in the lesson.

Acceptance (`prismal-host/tests/protocol.rs`): capabilities and malformed requests; a document from text and the same document from its IR give the same catalogue, canonical text and frames; located syntax and check diagnostics; a tool rename kept through a later text update, with spans following; a plain-text rename that breaks references refused with the document unchanged; removed identities reported; an interactive session (seek, control, undo) and a lesson (refused and accepted explore input, continue, the second drop from 20 m); inputs of the wrong mode refused (HI-E03); programs freed when their instances and documents close.

## Web player

`crates/prismal-web` is the reference web host (D-018): the host interface compiled to WebAssembly; `web/` renders what it returns. Build and run instructions are in `web/README.md`.

| Part | Content |
|---|---|
| `Player` (`prismal-web/src/lib.rs`) | one document and one instance, as the reference renderer uses them; source diagnostics as line and column |
| `mathml` | a formula's math box tree written as MathML for the browser (D-046), added to frames by `Player` and by the `Engine` binding |
| `examples` | the reference programs embedded from their documents at build time, assembled as the acceptance tests read them |
| `wasm` | JavaScript bindings (`wasm-bindgen`): `WebPlayer` for the reference renderer, and `Engine`, the host protocol for any web host; values cross as JSON strings |
| `web/player.js` | spatial views as SVG in the frame's viewport (grid and axes with ticks in metres), plot views as SVG with their ranges, panels and overlays as HTML (sliders, number inputs, toggles, MathML formulas with live values, labels), pointer, wheel and key events forwarded raw to the engine (D-047) with pointer capture and a grab cursor on hover, the browser's own focus told to the engine, lesson transport, captions, announcements, text alternatives |

A lesson is replayed from the learner's recorded inputs whenever one is added (`timeline::play` with the inputs), which the determinism of playback (PK-8.7) makes safe: frames before the new input are unchanged, which a test checks. Zoom, pan, pause and seeking are the renderer's; they never reach the model.

Lab presentations: RP-01, RP-03, RP-04 and RP-05 each declare a lab presentation with views (the projectile with its trace and height series, the bouncing ball in a plot with a length axis, the pendulum with its rod, trace, angle and energy series, the spring's mass and displacement series), and sliders for parameters that act during the run (gravity, drag, restitution, rod length, stiffness, mass). They play in the player as sessions of the running model; drags pause the run and resume it after the commit (PK-10.9, `hold`). `prismal-present/tests/labs.rs` checks them: positions at displayed instants against closed forms, the trace and series ending at the instant shown, seeking back and forth reproducing frames (RC-12.2), an intervention applying at the instant shown with an unchanged past and a later landing, undo, reset, the bouncing ball resting after the Zeno limit, the energy of the pendulum jumping when `L` changes, the spring's checked equation reported after `k` changes, and the static errors of sampled sources.

Acceptance: `prismal-web/tests/player.rs` loads every example, runs the 36 case expectations through the player, checks located diagnostics, RP-06's slider, drag, rejected drag and undo, RP-07's drag of `u`'s head, and RP-08's lesson (MathML of `R`, explore input at 60 deg landing at R60, unchanged earlier frames, refusal outside the explore beat, video medium). The front end was also driven in a headless browser through the same scripts (drags, keys, the explore slider, compile errors, phone width, light and dark themes).

## SVG renderer

`crates/prismal-svg` is the second renderer (PK-12.2): it draws a frame description as a standalone SVG document, with no browser. It reads only what the host interface gives every host, a layout and frames as JSON (HI section 5), and depends on no other Prismal crate, so it shows that frame descriptions are enough to draw a presentation and that renderers are swappable.

| Part | Content |
|---|---|
| `render(layout, frame, options)` | one document per frame: a header naming the presentation, run and instant; each view in a frame with its caption; spatial views in view coordinates with grid and axes, plot views with ticks, frame and clip; markers, arrows (colored in turn, labels, drag handles), segments, graphs, traces, polygons and groups; panels and the overlay with formulas and equations drawn from their layouts (D-046) with live values, controls in their current state (slider, toggle, number) with display units, buttons, tables, labels and statuses; captions; highlights, reveal opacity, drawn fractions and cameras (D-042); drag previews marked invalid |
| Accessibility | the document's title names the presentation, run and instant; its description lists the text alternatives; every representation carries its text alternative as a title (PK-11.1, D-026) |
| `Options` | plot width, largest view width, pixels per em of formulas, header, light and dark themes (the web player's colors) |
| `examples/render.rs` | `cargo run -p prismal-svg --example render -- PROGRAM PRESENTATION [--at T]... [--fps N] [--video] [--dark] [--out DIR]`: frames at chosen instants, or every frame at N per second, an image sequence for video |

Each view is drawn with the viewport its frame gives (D-047), as the web player draws it; the rest follows the web player's drawing (`web/player.js`): tick steps, marks and sizes. Sizes the web player keeps constant on screen are drawn at one document pixel per view pixel. Colors are presentation attributes, not style sheets, so any SVG consumer draws them. Panels, which the browser lays out as HTML, are stacked under their view.

Acceptance:

- `prismal-svg/tests/frames.rs`: every presentation with views of the reference programs and the guide, drawn at its start, a third of the way and its end (at least 60 documents): each is well formed, every representation is present with its text alternative, markers stand at the frame's view coordinates, formulas have one text element per text run of their layouts; panels, controls, buttons, tables, captions and the dark theme; DropMovie as an image sequence at 10 frames per second, with the ball fading in, the ground drawn, the view box halved by `zoom 2` and restored by `zoom 1`. The documents are written to `target/svg-tests` for inspection.
- `node crates/prismal-svg/compare.mjs` compares frames drawn by this renderer with the same frames drawn by the web player in headless Edge (13 frames of RP-01, RP-03 to RP-08 and the guide's wheel and DropMovie, sessions and lessons, cameras and fades): the view boxes of spatial views, and for every representation its text alternative and the geometry of its marks (marker and handle centres, line ends, path and polygon points; plots normalized to their frame). All 13 agree; a camera zoom perturbed by 1% is reported. The player opens a program, presentation and instant from its address for this (`#rp08/ProjectileLesson@20`).

## Media export

`crates/prismal-media` turns a presentation into a video file or raster images (D-052). Frames are the SVG renderer's; the crate rasterizes them with resvg and leaves encoding to ffmpeg, fed raw RGBA frames through a pipe.

| Part | Content |
|---|---|
| `clip(instance, presentation, settings)` | opens a lesson in the `video` medium (fallbacks, PK-9.10) or a session from the start of its run, and draws frame `k` at `k / fps` up to and including the end; collects captions and what the medium could not show (PK-12.3) |
| `Raster` | resvg with the system's fonts and any font directories; generic families resolve to the first installed common font |
| `canvas`, `draw` | one canvas per clip, the largest frame rounded up to even pixels; each frame drawn from its top left corner on the theme's background |
| `encode` | the encoder's arguments per container (`mp4`, `mov`, `mkv`: H.264; `webm`: VP9; `gif`: a generated palette), captions as a subtitle track when asked, a WebVTT file beside the video |
| `still`, `write_frames` | a PNG of one instant; a directory of PNG frames with `captions.vtt` and the encoder command |
| `prismal-media` (binary) | `prismal-media PROGRAM PRESENTATION OUT [--fps N] [--scale S] [--at T] [--until T] [--captions burned\|track\|both] [--dark] [--header] [--fonts DIR]... [--encoder PATH]` |

Acceptance: `prismal-media/tests/export.rs` checks frame instants, WebVTT, canvases and encoder arguments; exports RP-08 in the video medium (no report, captions from the narration, drawn or not, identical on a second export, frames of different sizes on one opaque canvas); reports a lesson whose explore beat has no fallback; records RP-04's session; writes a still and a frame directory; names a missing encoder. When ffmpeg is found (`PRISMAL_FFMPEG` or the path), RP-08 is encoded as MP4, WebM and GIF, and ffprobe counts the MP4's frames and finds its caption track; otherwise that test says so and passes.


| Program | Covered by the prototype | Not yet covered |
|---|---|---|
| RP-01 | E1 to E9, D1 to D5, IR JSON round trip | - |
| RP-02 | E1 to E12 | - |
| RP-03 | E1 to E15, D1 to D3, model variant V1 | - |
| RP-04 | E1 to E11, D1, D2 | - |
| RP-05 | E1 to E10, D1 to D3 | - |
| RP-06 | E1 to E14, through the presentation and on the session alone | - |
| RP-07 | E1 to E5 through the presentation (frame after the drag), D1 to D6 | - |
| RP-08 | E1 to E16: cases A to D | Audio narration (not required: PK-11.3) |

Every run in the suite is also run twice and compared bit for bit (RC-14.5).

## Measured accuracy

Provisional tolerances in the reference programs were confirmed with these measurements and are now fixed (their histories record the values).

| Program | Quantity | Measured | Tolerance |
|---|---|---|---|
| RP-01 | landing time, range | 1.4e-12 s, 2.0e-11 m | 1e-9 s, 1e-8 m |
| RP-02 default | landing time, range, apex height (relative) | 1.7e-7, 8.9e-8, 4.5e-7 | 1e-5 |
| RP-02 tight | same | 2.9e-12, 2.7e-12, 1.1e-11 | 1e-8 |
| RP-03 | Zeno detection | bounce 63 at 4.06370922186394 s (predicted: bounce 63 at 4.06370922604679 s) | bounce 61 to 65, within 1e-4 s of the limit |
| RP-04 `dopri5` | worst period (relative), energy drift | 2.0e-7, 7.7e-5 | 1e-5, 1e-3 |
| RP-04 `rk4` | same | 7.9e-9, 1.35e-7 | 1e-6, 1e-6 |
| RP-05 `dopri5` | `x(10 s)`, energy drift | 2.1e-7 m, 4.9e-5 | 1e-5 m, 1e-3 |
| RP-05 `rk4` | same | 2.4e-9 m, 1.8e-8 | 1e-7 m, 1e-7 |

The energy drifts agree with the predictions of `tools/refvals.py` (RP-04: 7.8e-5 and 1.3e-7).

## Findings

- **D-038.** The specification's rule for self-retriggering events (MK-15.11) contradicted the reference programs: read literally it accepted the bouncing ball without a Zeno policy; read as RP-03 describes it, it rejected the valid projectile. The rule now follows flows, specialized on the discrete values the handler sets.
- **Diagnostics come in groups.** An invalid variant can produce a secondary diagnostic besides the named one (RP-01.D4 also gives MK-E16, because the invalid flow condition defeats the specialization of D-038). The suite requires the named diagnostic to be among those reported.
- **D-039.** The IR had no form for `π`, so `2π` could only be stored as `6.283...` and formulas (D-034) could not show it. Named constants are now kept by name.
- **D-040.** The reserved-word list of D-035 rejected names the reference programs use (`process drag`, `view scene`, the observation `state`). Presentation, timeline and run words are now contextual keywords; RP-07's observation is renamed `values`.
- **Lexical rules made precise** in the working syntax: a unit has no spaces inside it (`0.01 /m` is a unit, `4 / m` a division); only `π` may follow a number directly; after a declaration's value `in` starts its range, so a membership test there needs parentheses.
- **RP-08 arrows without scales.** `arrow(vel, from: pos)` draws a velocity in a view whose scale maps lengths; PK-5.5 requires a declared scale of the vector's dimension, as the specification's own example (13.1) has. The presentation checker rejected RP-08 (PK-E04); the program now declares `scale: 1 m/s -> 2 px` (its history records it).
- **Formulas need parameter names.** `formula(f)` shows `f(x) = a x^2` (D-034), but IR lambdas kept no parameter names. Lambdas now carry display-only `names` (04-ir section 6).
- **Exact event instants at the end of a wait.** After `run rate 0.5 until landed`, the time mapping's arithmetic (`0 + 0.5 × elapsed presentation time`) gave an instant just before the landing, so the explore branch and the relaunch of RP-08 happened before the landing and playback passed it twice. A beat ended by `wait_until(E)` now shows `E`'s located instant exactly (PK-9.3a).
- **Rules the timeline needed**, recorded as elaborations in 03: the mapping persists across beats (PK-8.2a), reading time and highlight duration (PK-9.2b), waits while holding (PK-9.4a), lesson run end and run versions (PK-9.5a), refusal of learner actions (PK-9.8a), keyboard steps (PK-11.2a; RP-06's marker declares no step, so it moves by 1/100 of the axis span), announcements (PK-11.3a).
- **Display units were not used.** RP-08 narrates the launch angle in degrees and ranges its explore slider in degrees, but the slider showed radians: RP-01's `angle` declared no display unit, and the presentation kernel ignored display units in text alternatives and live formula values although PK-11.1 requires them. RP-01's `angle` now declares `unit deg` (its history records it) and the kernel formats a binding's value in its display unit (`text::fmt_binding`).
- **Keyboard operation of arrow heads.** PK-11.2 requires every drag to be available from the keyboard; the kernel only moved markers. A keyboard step now moves the part a representation is dragged by (a marker, an arrow's head).
- **Plots had no dimensions.** A plot's axes were bare numbers, so neither a scalar model (the bouncing ball's `y` is a length) nor a series against time could be drawn. Plot axes now take their dimension from their ranges (PK-7.3a), and `trace` and `series_plot` take sampled sources (PK-6.3a) with their syntax, `expr every Δ`, and IR form.
- **Equation diagnostics.** A failed equation check printed its residual as `Some(0.0148...)`. The message now gives the instant and the residual.
- **D-041.** Writing the guide, `event alarm on full` never happened: the runtime made `on(E)` due only after `emit E`, following RC section 8.1, while MK-15.3 says after `E` occurs. `on(E)` now follows both.
- **Proposals that read bindings.** The player's intervention log evaluated a drag proposal (`speed = sqrt(p.x * 1 m * g / sin(2 * angle))`) as a constant, and the kernel indexed an empty state and panicked. `constant` now refuses expressions that read bindings or derivatives; the log evaluates proposals on the run's state at their instant.
- **Native and WebAssembly runs differ in the last digits.** Comparing the renderers, RP-08's ball at rest after landing is at `y = -7.06e-10 m` natively and `-1.06e-10 m` in the browser: the elementary functions of the two builds round differently. This is the tolerance-equivalence across platforms that D-015 allows; the comparison checks numbers in text alternatives to 1e-6.
- **Italic correction.** Superscripts and closing parentheses touched the slanted top of italic letters in formula layouts (`v²`, `f(x)`). An italic run now takes 0.06 em more room after it (`math.rs`); renderers draw layouts with serif faces that have true italics, whose widths the layout approximates.
- **Input belonged to each host.** The host interface took only semantic inputs, so each host had to hit-test, map screen positions to view coordinates and keep focus, and the web player's framing (extent, growth, camera, zoom and pan) had to be copied into the SVG renderer. The host now captures and forwards input and the engine interprets it (D-047); both renderers draw with the viewport in the frame. A session's framing now grows to fit each frame on its own, where the web player's used to keep the growth of earlier frames, so the same instant always gives the same frame.
- **Requests ignored enabling conditions.** A requested event ran its handler even when its `if` condition was false, contrary to MK-15.5; found with payloads (`on request(j: Momentum) if j > 0 kg*m/s`). Requests now obey their conditions (RC-11.6b).
- **Constants in constant expressions.** Case parameters and expected values were evaluated with no binding values at all, so a declared function that reads a constant (`apex(10 m/s)` reading `g`) could not be called there. Constant expressions now see the model's constants (`CModel::constant_values`).
- **Expected cases need a type.** `(phase on top) == sinking` compiled the expected side with no expected type, and a case has none of its own; an expected value now takes the enumeration of its subject.
- **Products of words.** `0.5 * mass * speed^2` was typeset `0.5massspeed²`; a thin space now separates a name of more than one letter from its neighbours in a product.
- **`emit` semantics.** A first version made the emitted event itself due; MK-15.10 makes the events triggered `on(E)` due. Fixed and covered by a unit test with the cascade limit (RC-8.3).
